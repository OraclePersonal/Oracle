/**
 * Promote working memories that have been accessed `minAccessCount` or more
 * times into durable `insight` memories for long-term retention.
 *
 * The promotion can be performed in one of three ways:
 *   1. **moveFn** – An atomic move operation (create under the new type +
 *                   delete the old file in one logical step). Preferred when
 *                   the backend supports it (e.g. `MemoryAdapter.moveMemory`).
 *   2. **saveFn + deleteFn** – Save a copy with `type: "insight"` under the
 *                              new type directory, then delete the original.
 *   3. **Neither** – Entries are still identified but not persisted (dry-run).
 *
 * Promoted entries have their `accessCount` reset to 0 and `lastAccessed` set
 * to the promotion timestamp. A `promotedFrom` record is stored in `meta` so
 * the provenance trail is preserved.
 *
 * @param entries  – All loaded memory entries (caller is responsible for scope).
 * @param opts     – Override the minimum access count.
 * @param saveFn   – Callback to persist a newly promoted entry. Required when
 *                   `moveFn` is not provided (used together with `deleteFn`).
 * @param deleteFn – Callback to remove the original working entry after
 *                   promoting. Required when `moveFn` is not provided.
 * @param moveFn   – Atomic move callback that re-types an entry in one
 *                   operation. When given, `saveFn` and `deleteFn` are unused.
 * @returns        The IDs of working entries that were promoted.
