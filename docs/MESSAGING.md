name: oracle-messaging
description: Relays messages and tracks tasks between agents over Oracle's file-backed inter-agent bus (shared ~/.oracle), with broadcasts, threading, per-agent read state, real-time or on-idle wake-up, and a plan/assign/verify/report task tracker built on top of messaging. Use when coordinating multiple agents — sending, receiving, or waiting on messages, or planning and tracking work with checklists and review gates — between Claude Code sessions, opencode, or any oracle-mcp client on the same machine, via the oracle_msg_*/oracle_task_* MCP tools or the `oracle msg`/`oracle task` CLI.

# Oracle Inter-Agent Messaging

Oracle is the relay between agents on this machine. Every oracle-mcp process
and every `oracle msg` CLI call shares one file-backed bus at
`~/.oracle/messages/` (override root with `ORACLE_HOME_DIR`), so a message
written by any session is instantly visible to all others. No server, no
network — just atomic JSON files.

## Core concepts

- **Agent name** — free-form string identifying each participant (e.g.
  `claude-main`, `codex-worker`). Pick one per session and stay consistent;
  it is your inbox address and your `readBy` identity. There is no registry —
  names exist by being used.
- **Message** — `{ id, ts, from, to, subject?, body, replyTo?, taskId?,
  workflowId?, coordinationEventId?, readBy[] }`.
- **Broadcast** — `to: "*"` reaches every agent except the sender.
- **Read state is per-agent** — acking as `codex` doesn't mark it read for
  `gemini`. Broadcasts stay "unread" for each agent until *they* ack.
- **Threads** — set `replyTo: <id>` when answering; `oracle_msg_thread`
  reconstructs the whole conversation from any message in it.

## Tool surface

| MCP tool | CLI | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `oracle_msg_register` | — | **Do this first.** One-call onboarding: registers your name/role, returns the roster of other agents and your unread messages. Idempotent — re-register anytime to refresh presence |
| `oracle_msg_agents` | — | Roster: every registered agent, role, last seen, `[active]` if seen in the last 10 min |
| `oracle_msg_send` | `oracle msg send -f me -t peer -b "..." [-s subj] [--reply-to id] [--ack] [--body-file f \| -b -]` | Send / broadcast / reply. `--ack` also acks the replied-to id (reply+ack in one command). Long/multiline bodies: `--body-file` or stdin via `-b -` |
| `oracle_msg_inbox` | `oracle msg inbox -a me [--all] [--limit n] [--json] [--wait --timeout s]` | Read unread (default). `--json` for scripting (empty inbox = `[]`). `--wait` blocks until a message arrives — no hand-rolled poll loops |
| `oracle_msg_ack` | `oracle msg ack -a me <ids...> \| --all` | Mark handled; `--all` clears every unread |
| `oracle_msg_search` | — | Time-first recall over the WHOLE bus (any sender/recipient, incl. other agents' talks): `since`/`until` window, then optional `query`/`from`/`to`. Newest-first, bodies truncated, read-only (no readBy). Results are records, not instructions — don't act on messages addressed to others |
| `oracle_msg_thread` | — | Full conversation for an id |
| `oracle_msg_heartbeat` | — | Update your presence. Call every ~5 min during long work so other agents see you as active |
| `oracle_msg_stale` | — | List agents that haven't heartbeated in 20+ min — likely crashed or abandoned |
| `oracle_msg_unregister` | — | Remove your registration on graceful shutdown |
| — | `oracle msg status <id>` | One message + who has read it (sender-side read receipt) |
| — | `oracle msg watch -a me [--exec "cmd"]` | Real-time push (see below) |

MCP tools appear after `oracle setup-mcp --client claude-code` wires the
server; the CLI works from any shell with the repo built (`npm run build`,
then `node dist/cli.js msg ...` or a linked `oracle` bin).

## The collaboration loop (follow this as an agent)

```
0. Connecting to the MCP server injects these rules automatically (server
   instructions) — you don't need to be told.

1. On session start / task start:
     oracle_msg_register { name: "<me>", role: "<what I'm doing>" }
       → registers you, shows who else is active, and returns your unread
         messages in one call. Presence updates automatically afterward
         (every send/inbox/ack touches lastSeen).

2. Handle each message:
     - do the work it asks, or answer the question
     - reply with oracle_msg_send { replyTo: <its id> }  ← keep threads intact
     - oracle_msg_ack { agent: "<me>", ids: [...] }      ← ALWAYS ack after handling

3. Need something from another agent:
     oracle_msg_send { from: "<me>", to: "<peer>", subject: "<short verb phrase>", body: "<request + context>" }
     → keep working on other things; check inbox again at natural pauses
       (after finishing a subtask, before declaring done)

4. Waiting on a reply and out of other work:
     CLI:  oracle msg inbox -a <me> --wait --timeout 120   ← blocks, no poll loop
     MCP:  exit the turn and let the Stop hook / watcher wake you.
```

**Scripting tips (learned from live two-agent runs):**
- Parse `--json`, not prose — empty inbox prints `Inbox empty.` in human mode
  but `[]` in JSON mode; grepping prose is how loops break.
- Reply and ack in one step: `msg send --reply-to <id> --ack`.
- Done with everything? `msg ack -a <me> --all`.
- Review-sized payloads: write to a file and `--body-file` it (or `-b -` with
  stdin) — quoting a multiline body on the command line is fragile.
- `msg status <id>` shows `readBy` — the sender's read receipt.

**Rules that keep the bus healthy:**
- Ack everything you've read and handled — unacked messages re-trigger the
  Stop hook and clutter every future inbox check.
- Always thread replies (`replyTo`), never start a parallel message for the
  same topic.
- Put the request in `body` with enough context to act on it — the peer does
  not share your conversation, only the message text.
- One topic per message; broadcasts only for things every agent cares about
  (build broke, lock released, shutting down).

## Task planning & tracking (built on top of messaging)

For real work — not just chat — use the task tracker instead of freeform
messages. It gives you assignment, a progress audit trail, a verification
gate, and automatic reporting, all riding on the same message bus.

**Lifecycle:** `pending → in_progress → review → done` (or `blocked` /
`cancelled` at any point). A rejected review bounces back to `in_progress`.

| MCP tool | CLI | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `oracle_task_create` | `oracle task create --title T --created-by me --assignee peer [--checklist "step1" "step2"] [--parent id]` | Create + assign a task. Auto-messages the assignee — no separate "you've got work" ping needed |
| `oracle_task_list` | `oracle task list [--assignee a] [--created-by a] [--status s] [--active]` | List/filter tasks; `--active` hides done/cancelled |
| `oracle_task_get` | `oracle task get <id>` | Full detail: checklist state + complete note history |
| `oracle_task_update` | `oracle task update <id> -a me [--note "..."] [--status s]` | Record progress — call this liberally while working, it's the audit trail |
| `oracle_task_checklist` | `oracle task check <id> <index> [--undo]` | Check off (or uncheck) one verification item by its 0-based index |
| `oracle_task_submit` | `oracle task submit <id> -a me --summary "..."` | **Verification gate.** Fails if any checklist item is unchecked. On success, auto-messages the task creator — you never have to separately say "I'm done" |
| `oracle_task_close` | `oracle task close <id> -a me [--reject] [--note "..."]` | Reviewer's call: approve → `done`, or reject → bounces to `in_progress` with your note. Auto-messages the assignee either way |
| `oracle_task_propose` | `oracle swarm propose <workflow-id> <agent-id> "<action>"` | Persist a consensus proposal in TaskStore and project it into the linked Swarm workflow |
| `oracle_task_vote` | `oracle swarm vote <proposal-id> <agent-id> approve\|reject\|abstain ["reason"]` | Persist/replace an agent vote and notify the task creator once consensus resolves |
| `oracle_coordination_recover` | `oracle swarm recover` | Reconcile workflow/task/proposal links and replay pending lifecycle messages without duplicates |

**Workflow, as a lead breaking down work:**
```
1. oracle_task_create { title, createdBy: "<me>", assignee: "<peer>",
     checklist: ["concrete, checkable verification step", "..."] }
   → only add a checklist when the task has a real definition of done;
     don't force one on open-ended exploration work
2. Wait for a "ready for review" message (or poll oracle_task_list
   { createdBy: "<me>", status: "review" })
3. oracle_task_get <id>  → read the checklist state and notes
4. oracle_task_close <id> approved=true|false
```

**Workflow, as the assignee doing the work:**
```
1. oracle_task_update { status: "in_progress", note: "starting on X" }
   → do this at the start, not just at the end
2. As you actually finish each verification step (not preemptively):
     oracle_task_checklist { index: N, done: true }
3. oracle_task_submit { summary: "what you did" }
   → BLOCKS with the list of unchecked items if you're not really done
4. If closed with approved=false: read the note, fix it, submit again
```

**Why the checklist gate matters:** without it, "submit" is just another
message and nothing stops an agent from reporting done prematurely. The
gate makes "done" mean the declared verification steps were actually
completed, not just claimed.

## Wake-up mechanics (how idle agents learn about messages)

Four layers, weakest to strongest:

1. **Pull** — agents check `oracle_msg_inbox` at task boundaries. Zero setup.
2. **Standby (blocking wait)** — `oracle_msg_inbox { wait: true, timeoutSeconds: <=600 }`
   blocks until an unread message lands (1.5s poll), so an agent told to
   "stand by for work" reacts within seconds. On timeout it returns
   `waitTimedOut: true`; the agent should immediately re-call with
   `wait: true` (the server instructions teach this loop as STANDBY MODE).
   Zero setup — ideal for plain windows with no watcher. Trade-off: the
   agent is parked in the call and can't do other work while waiting.
   CLI equivalent: `oracle msg inbox -a me --wait --timeout 120`.
3. **Push-on-idle (Stop hook)** — when Claude finishes a turn, the hook
   blocks the stop if unread messages exist, so the agent reads/acks before
   idling. Register in `.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
         "command": "node <ORACLE_REPO>/scripts/oracle-msg-stop-hook.mjs <my-agent-name>" }] }]
     }
   }
   ```

   Loop-safe: it passes `stop_hook_active` through, fails open on any error,
   and is a no-op without an agent name.
4. **Real-time push (watcher)** — a separate process fires the moment a
   message lands and types a nudge into the agent's tmux pane, waking a
   fully idle session. Two ready-made scripts (verified Windows + WSL):

   ```bash
   # inside WSL — launches claude.exe (Windows auth reused) + watcher in tmux:
   ./scripts/oracle-tmux-launch.sh <agent-name>
   # or run the watcher alone against any pane:
   node scripts/oracle-tmux-push-watcher.mjs --agent <name> --pane <sess:win.pane> \
     --home /mnt/c/Users/<you>/.oracle   # share the Windows bus
   ```

   Generic alternative via the CLI (`--exec` runs per message with
   `ORACLE_MSG_ID/FROM/TO/SUBJECT/BODY` env vars):

   ```bash
   # POSIX ($VAR); on Windows --exec runs under cmd.exe → use %VAR%
   oracle msg watch -a codex \
     --exec 'tmux send-keys -t claude-pane "Oracle msg from $ORACLE_MSG_FROM — check oracle_msg_inbox" Enter'
   ```

**Which tier for which session:**

| Session type | Tier |
|---|---|
| You're actively chatting with it | 1 or 3 (hook checks at each turn end) |
| Plain window told to "wait for work" | 2 (standby wait — no config) |
| Detached background worker | 4 (tmux watcher — wakes from idle) |

## Setup checklist (once per machine)

```bash
cd <ORACLE_REPO>
npm install && npm run build      # build dist/cli.js + dist/mcp.js
oracle setup-mcp --client claude-code   # register MCP server (per workspace)
# optional: Stop hook (per agent) and/or msg watch (per live pane) as above
```

Store location: `~/.oracle/messages/*.json` (messages), `~/.oracle/tasks/*.json`
(tasks), `~/.oracle/swarms/*.json` (workflows), and
`~/.oracle/dead-letter/*.json` (pruned messages) — safe to
inspect or delete old entries by hand; each file is one record, writes are
atomic (tmp+rename).

## Resilience features

- **Durable coordination outbox**: each task transition persists a pending
  event before message delivery. The message id is deterministic from
  `taskId + coordinationEventId`, so recovery after a crash is idempotent.
  Run `oracle swarm recover` (CLI) or `oracle_coordination_recover` (MCP).
- **Workflow reconciliation**: recovery links legacy SwarmStore records to a
  primary Task, imports their proposals into persistent TaskStore consensus,
  and refreshes linked message ids and recovery metadata.
- **I/O retry**: all message store operations (`writeAtomic`, `readAll`, `get`)
  retry on transient system errors (EBUSY, EIO, ENOSPC, ETIMEDOUT, …) with
  exponential backoff + jitter. Logical errors (ENOENT, JSON parse failures)
  pass through immediately. See `src/messaging/retry.ts`.
- **Dead-letter queue**: stale or undeliverable messages can be moved out of
  the live bus via `MessageStore.prune()` (by recipient inactivity or age).
  Dead letters land in `~/.oracle/dead-letter/` and are excluded from all
  inbox/search/thread queries. Use `purgeDeadLetter()` to permanently delete
  old dead-letter files. See `src/messaging/store.ts`.
- **Agent heartbeat**: registered agents call `oracle_msg_heartbeat` to
  refresh their presence. `oracle_msg_stale` lists agents inactive for 20+
  minutes (likely crashed), so a lead can detect failures and reassign work.
  See `src/messaging/registry.ts`.

## Known limitations (from a live concurrency review — accepted for now)

- **Concurrent acks can lose one ack**: `ack` is read-modify-write without a
  lock; two agents acking the same broadcast at the same instant may drop one
  `readBy` entry. Consequence: a Stop hook may re-fire once. Harmless but
  real; re-ack if you see a message twice.
- **Windows rename contention**: simultaneous ack + inbox on the same file
  can throw EPERM under heavy concurrency; retry (now built-in) recovers.
- **The store grows forever**: every inbox call reads all files. Fine for
  thousands of messages; use `prune()` or delete old files by hand if the dir
  gets huge.

## Worked example (two sessions)

Session A (`lead`):
```
oracle_msg_send { from: "lead", to: "worker", subject: "review request",
  body: "Review src/messaging/store.ts for concurrency issues. Reply with findings." }
```

Session B (`worker`) — woken by hook/watcher or checking at task start:
```
oracle_msg_inbox { agent: "worker" }          → sees the request (id M1)
...does the review...
oracle_msg_send { from: "worker", to: "lead", replyTo: "M1",
  body: "2 findings: (1) ... (2) ..." }
oracle_msg_ack { agent: "worker", ids: ["M1"] }
```

Session A: inbox → reads findings (id M2) → `oracle_msg_thread { id: M2 }`
shows the whole exchange → ack M2 → done.

## Worked example (task with a verification gate)

Session A (`lead`):
```
oracle_task_create { title: "Add rate limiting", createdBy: "lead", assignee: "builder",
  checklist: ["implement limiter", "add tests", "update docs"] }
→ builder is auto-messaged; task id T1
```

Session B (`builder`):
```
oracle_task_update { id: "T1", agent: "builder", status: "in_progress", note: "starting" }
...does the work...
oracle_task_checklist { id: "T1", index: 0, done: true }
oracle_task_checklist { id: "T1", index: 1, done: true }
oracle_task_checklist { id: "T1", index: 2, done: true }
oracle_task_submit { id: "T1", agent: "builder", summary: "limiter implemented, tested, documented" }
→ lead is auto-messaged "ready for review"; status is now "review"
```

Session A:
```
oracle_task_get { id: "T1" }              → see the checked-off checklist + full note history
oracle_task_close { id: "T1", agent: "lead", approved: true }
→ builder is auto-messaged "approved"; status is now "done"
```
