# ✅ Oracle MCP Setup Complete

## What We've Done

### 1. ✅ Verified Oracle Installation
- Built TypeScript → JavaScript
- Tested CLI: `oracle doctor` ✓
- Verified Codex authentication ✓

### 2. ✅ Setup MCP for Claude Code
- Generated `.mcp.json` configuration
- MCP server points to `dist/mcp.js`
- Workspace root correctly configured

### 3. ✅ Tested All Core Features
- **Memory:** Listed, searched, stored facts
- **Messaging:** Created message bus, sent messages between agents
- **Tasks:** Created, tracked, verified, submitted, approved workflow
- **Multi-Agent:** 4 agents working simultaneously (test-agent, frontend, backend, reviewer)

### 4. ✅ Created Documentation
- `ORACLE_QUICKSTART.md` — Step-by-step guide
- `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` — Verification checklist
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md` — How to use in Claude Code
- `.claude/skills/oracle-mcp-usage/SKILL.md` — Tool reference

## What Needs to Be Done Now

### 👉 IMMEDIATE: Start Using in Claude Code

**Step 1: Restart Claude Code**
```bash
# Close Claude Code completely
# Reopen it
# In terminal, verify tools appear:
# Try typing "oracle_" to see autocomplete
```

**Step 2: Try One Tool**
```json
// In Claude Code, call oracle_ask with your first question:
Tool: oracle_ask
Input: {
  "question": "What is the Oracle project?",
  "files": ["README.md"]
}
```

**Step 3: Remember a Fact**
```json
Tool: oracle_memory_remember
Input: {
  "content": "Oracle MCP is set up and working on this project",
  "tags": ["oracle", "setup", "complete"]
}
```

### 🚀 OPTIONAL: Test Multi-Agent Workflow

Run the example workflow with 4 terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Lead
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs lead

# Terminal 2: Frontend
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs frontend

# Terminal 3: Backend
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs backend

# Terminal 4: Reviewer
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs reviewer
```

All 3 work agents will:
- Pick up their tasks from lead
- Message each other
- Complete verification checklists
- Submit to lead
- Lead approves → all done

---

## Storage & Data

All Oracle data stored locally:

```
~/.oracle/
├─ messages/          # Message bus (inter-agent communication)
├─ tasks/             # Task tracker (work assignments + verification)
├─ agents/            # Presence registry (who's online)
├─ memory/            # Persistent knowledge base (facts + entity graph)
├─ runtime/           # SQLite scheduler/events + daemon state/log
└─ .sessions/         # Consultation history (optional)
```

**Zero external services.** Coordination stores use atomic local files;
Runtime uses a local SQLite database.

---

## Next: Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Persistent Memory Across Sessions

**Session 1:** Learn something
```json
Tool: oracle_memory_remember
Input: {
  "content": "Dashboard performance issue is in the card rendering loop",
  "tags": ["dashboard", "performance", "bug"]
}
```

**Session 2 (later):** Recall automatically
```json
Tool: oracle_ask
Input: {
  "question": "What performance issues do we have?"
}
```

Oracle includes the memory from Session 1 in its answer.

---

### Use Case 2: Ask with Full Context

```json
Tool: oracle_ask
Input: {
  "question": "Review this code for security issues",
  "files": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "conversationId": "security-review-1"
}
```

Oracle reads all your TS files, checks memory for prior security findings, searches your docs, and gives you a thorough review.

---

### Use Case 3: Multi-Session Coordination

**Session A (Lead):**
```json
Tool: oracle_task_create
Input: {
  "title": "Implement password reset feature",
  "assignee": "frontend-worker",
  "checklist": ["Design flow", "Build form", "Add tests"]
}
```

**Session B (Frontend Worker):**
```json
Tool: oracle_msg_inbox
Input: { "agent": "frontend-worker" }
```
Sees the task, starts working...

```json
Tool: oracle_msg_send
Input: {
  "to": "backend-worker",
  "body": "Need a POST /auth/password-reset endpoint"
}
```

**Session C (Backend Worker):**
```json
Tool: oracle_msg_inbox
Input: { "agent": "backend-worker" }
```
Sees frontend's request, builds the endpoint...

Both submit work to lead. Lead approves. Feature done!

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to commit these docs?**
A: Yes! They're part of setting up Oracle for your team. Commit:
- `.mcp.json`
- `.oracle/config.json`
- `ORACLE_QUICKSTART.md`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md`
- `examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs`

Ignore: `~/.oracle/` (that's local agent state)

**Q: Can I use this with multiple machines?**
A: Not yet. Oracle uses local file-backed stores. For cross-machine coordination, you'd need to run an Oracle MCP server that other machines connect to. Currently designed for single-machine multi-agent coordination.

**Q: Does memory get too big?**
A: Memory auto-consolidates every hour (removes duplicates, promotes frequently-used facts). You can manually prune old facts: `oracle memory prune --days 30`

**Q: What if I restart Claude Code?**
A: All memory, messages, and tasks persist in `~/.oracle/`. When you restart, agents re-register and see their pending work.

**Q: Can I use this with other MCP clients?**
A: Yes! The same `.mcp.json` can wire Oracle into opencode, Codex CLI, or any MCP-compatible client. Just point them at the same `ORACLE_WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

## Commands to Keep Handy

```bash
# Verify installation
node dist/cli.js doctor

# List all memory
node dist/cli.js memory list

# Search memory
node dist/cli.js memory search "query"

# Consolidate memory (remove duplicates)
node dist/cli.js memory consolidate

# List all messages
node dist/cli.js msg inbox -a "agent-name"

# List all tasks
node dist/cli.js task list

# View task detail
node dist/cli.js task get <task-id>

# Example multi-agent workflow
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs lead
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs frontend
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs backend
node examples/workflow-dashboard.mjs reviewer
```

## What's Next?

1. **Today:** Restart Claude Code, try `oracle_ask` once
2. **Tomorrow:** Use memory + messaging to coordinate 2 Claude Code sessions
3. **This Week:** Run the full 4-agent workflow example
4. **This Month:** Build your own multi-agent coordination patterns
